# 1 - What do you need to know to join the project

## Computer science knowledge
### github
Github is where all the project information is stored and how the project is managed. There are several trainings available online that you could take on GitHub. Do a basic search on GitHub 101 and take one of the many available online trainings.
Since you are already here, I suspect you already know the basics of GitHib.
### python
Python is the language used to develop the application. There are many ways for a scout to collaborate on this project without having to know python programing. However, if coding is your thing, we do it here in Python. No Java. No nothing. Just Python.
### flask
Flask is the framework used to develop the app. If you want to code for this project, tjhis is an essential skill. Here is one of the many tutorials available for you to get to know Flask:

We recommend that you do at least the first 5 chapters to have a basic understanding of Flask.
### web design
This application is designed to run on desktops and iphones. We need someone (or manyones) to design the interface. No tech skills needed, just good visual experience and willing to help.
